Be sure to fetch from upstream before doing any work so you can have the most recent code base to work with.

Please be sure to commit and push any changes you make before leaving for the night. Unless the feature you are working on is not yet complete. In that case, don't push.

Also, please use 4 spaces for tabs.

Just testing the whole adding and updating!

Note: We need to organize every features we have and have the table visualized.
Aka, converting our ER diagram into a table, that would be a good place to get started.
In the mean time though, I am planning on familiarizing myself with the codes.
