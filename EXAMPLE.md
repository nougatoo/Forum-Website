I am going to use this file to show and explain a couple examples as to how we can build our relations with SQL queries.
Each table is equivalent to a relation.
Each table is created with one single query.

When writing queries for tables that contain a foreign key, the table containing the foreign key has to exist BEFORE the query will run.
